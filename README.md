## [Hasherino](hasherino)

Hasherino lets you enter some text and displays its SHA-1 hash. (You can do the same with [CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/#recipe=Fork('%5C%5Cn','%5C%5Cn',false)SHA1(80)).)

It also displays a strength (order of magnitude of estimated number of guesses needed) and the time needed to crack it (at a speed of 10 kH/s).

Password strength estimation is done using [zxcvbn](https://github.com/dropbox/zxcvbn).
